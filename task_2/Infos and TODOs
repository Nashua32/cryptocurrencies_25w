Check if the node itself is included in the peers message
	- if not, fix it as in task 1

INFOS:
I CHANGED THE DOCKERFILE, SINCE I THINK THE DATABASE DOESNT GET CREATED WITH THE ORIGINAL (NOT COMMENTED OUT) COMMANDS.

HOW TO TEST THE APPLICATION:
In the directory with the docker-compose.yml file run: 
	docker compose up --build

Then open another terminal and run
	nc localhost 18018

Then the application will send you a hello and getpeers message.
You can then send your own messages. Here are some messages that you can send (just paste them into the terminal):

hello:
{"type":"hello","version":"0.10.0","agent":""}

getpeers:
{"type":"getpeers"}

peers:
{"peers":["block-ness-monster.12122393.xyz:18018","84.115.234.142:19518","41.66.68.47:63213","41.66.68.47:63024","128.130.112.69:46940","178.115.64.112:15896","41.66.68.47:61155","104.248.244.102:60026","78.104.182.48:64076","164.90.163.70:46342","128.130.122.75:18018","128.130.112.69:36906","128.131.80.223:56712","188.23.142.231:59255","213.47.146.220:42152","41.66.68.47:65136","kerma.zlayer.org:18018","kerma.necronda.net:18018","41.66.68.47:64412","128.131.80.223:60310","128.131.80.223:60323","78.104.182.48:37081","128.130.112.69:35382","128.130.246.138:58006","213.47.75.68:47024","128.140.95.112:18018","128.130.244.254:48428","213.47.75.68:41880","104.248.244.102:33630","104.248.244.102:33626"],"type":"peers"}
